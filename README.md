Repo for Trilogy Education Services

Hi Stacey!

I am new to coding, but I will learn as much as I can with the same tenacity that I has led me to acquire my Master's degree. I am very passionate about furthering education, so I believe I would be a perfect fit for Trilogy Education. I am also a great employee and fun to work with. I'm looking forward to working with everyone at Trilogy.
